/**
 * This class represents a train departure. It has a field for the train's departure time as 
 * a LocalTime value, because we want it portrayed as hh:mm. 
 * 
 * <p>The next field is the line, which i have set as a string. This is because the line is a word 
 * or a name. 
 * 
 * <p>The next field is the trainnumber, which is set as an integer, due to it being a number. 
 * 
 * <p>The field destination is a string.
 * 
 * <p>The schedule is a set plan and the fields that would change the schedule are departureTime and
 * destination. Therefore they are both private final fields with no set method.
 * 
 *<p>Neither the line og trainnumber has a set method and are both private final fields, as they 
 * identify the train and they are not something we wish to change. 
 * 
 * <p>The track is an integer and has a set method. The train's track would still follow the set schedule 
 * if it changed tracks so it is a private, but not final field. 
 * 
 * <p>The delay is portrayed as hh:mm and is therefore set as a LocalTime value. The time of delay 
 * is unpredictable and has a set method. The field is private, but not final.
 * 
 * <p>A train departure with departure time null, line as an empty string, train number below 0 or over 
 * 1000, destination as an empty string, track below 0 or over 100 or a 0 delay would not be a valid
 * train departure.

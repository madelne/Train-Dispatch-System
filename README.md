## Project description

[//]: # This project is a system of traindepartures.

## Project structure

[//]: # My project is structured with three classes that are stored in the scr/main/java/edu/ntnu/stud package. The TrainDeparture <p>class, the TrainDeparteRegister class and the TrainDispatchApp class. The user interface TrainDispatchApp is stored in the package ui <p>within the main package. The JUnit-test classes are stored in the src/test/java/edu/ntnu/stud package. 

## Link to repository

[//]: # https://gitlab.stud.idi.ntnu.no/madelne/mappe 

## How to run the project

[//]: # The project is run from the user interface, TrainDispatchApp, that holds the main method. This class prints out a menu and the <p>user enters one of the numbers that is presented in the menu. The program is expected to alert the user if the entered input is not <p>valid and the user will get the chance to try again. Option 9 in the main menu will close the menu and the program will stop running.

## How to run the tests

[//]: # The tests will run automatically by running the the test classes.
